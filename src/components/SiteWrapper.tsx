          description="A full-stack daily web game inspired by Family Feud, where players guess the most popular answers to crowd-sourced prompts. I built it from scratch using React and FastAPI, integrating GPT-4 to generate dynamic answer sets. Combined with fuzzy string matching, it accepts close guesses and typos â€” making it feel like you're really on the show."

It fully simulates the instruction cycle, including cache modes, interrupt handling, and step-through debugging. I built it entirely in C over a semester, gaining a hands-on understanding of how CPUs actually execute code."
